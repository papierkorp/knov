# Metadata Browsing

KNOV provides browsing capabilities for the following metadata fields on the overview page (`/browse/files`):

- **Tags**: Browse files by tags
- **Collections**: Browse files by collection
- **Folders**: Browse files by folder
- **Type**: Browse files by type (todo, fleeting, literature, moc, permanent, filter, journaling)
- **Priority**: Browse files by priority (low, medium, high)
- **Status**: Browse files by status (draft, published, archived)
- **PARA Organization**: Browse files by projects, areas, resources, and archive

Each browse link shows the count of files with that metadata value. Clicking a browse link displays all files with that specific metadata.
